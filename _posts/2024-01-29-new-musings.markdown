I'm up insanely early for a training class, but it doesn't start for about 90 minutes, so I figured I'd use this time to finally post something.

Yes, I really am thinking seriously about moving to Vietnam pretty much permanently if I can swing it.  We are looking into property ownership by foreigners (getting citizenship is . . . unlikely, apparently, but residency is more feasible).  Just feels like it's time for me to leave here.  

I don't really like my house anymore.  It was purchased for my family, and, frankly, my family is scattered. My sister moved north, my parents are dead, my remaining family is all over the US (and rarely seen anyway). My ex doesn't care to interact with me (nor I with her), and one of my kids isn't speaking to me.  Plus there's just a lot of issues with this house, but when I think about fixing them, all I can think is, "why?"  I don't want to stay here.

So why so far away?  Moving internationally is a big challenge.  I'm just kind of sick of it here, frankly.  The politics have gotten incredibly awful, and I feel like I'd better get the hell out before every other country decides to keep US citizens on a pay-no-mind list.  Healthcare is absurdly expensive for results that are a joke compared to pretty much every other industrialized nation, and if, for some reason, I decide to stop working, I'm screwed on insurance until Medicare kicks in in my late 60s.  

My job will let me go pretty much anywhere as well, and having a training presence in southeast Asia isn't a bad thing.  Plus if I keep getting that salary, Vietnam is going to be good living.

My kids, well, they will be world travelers, this I know, plus getting back to the states from Vietnam is much less expensive than the other way around.  Just one of those weird facts.  

Anyway, let's see what the year brings.
