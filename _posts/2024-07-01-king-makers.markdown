The Crunchwrap Court has decided that apparently the president is above the law.  Of course, the Republicans want a king.  They've always wanted a king.  They've wanted to execute dissenters since Nixon.  So, here we go.  Bend the fucking knee or get the fuck out.  

Now all a president needs is to appoint a judge to a lower court who will decide every action he takes is official, and then it cannot be prosecuted.  

You think Cannon is gonna sit on this?  All she has to do now is declare stealing classified documents "official" and it's over.

Trump will never be prosecuted for incitement.  Now it's just official acts all the way down.

Remember this day when the journalists start to go missing.  When the civil rights leaders are silenced.  When the opposition party is simply a target list.  

It's done, people.  It was a nice idea while it lasted, but the rule of law is no more.  It's the rule of the tyrant.  

It's just a pity they didn't wait until July 4.  Could have killed the country on a nice even birthday.
