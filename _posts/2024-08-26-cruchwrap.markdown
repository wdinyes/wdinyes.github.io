So, it's annual compliance training time.  

As is usual, there's the security training course. And the insider trading course.  And the harassment course.  And the corruption and bribery course.

And I'm just really not accepting it.

Because I'm sitting here, watching Justice Thomas break all of these on a weekly basis.

Man, fuck that guy.  Hours of my life wasted, and he just gets to sit there taking away rights and twisting words to make whatever judgement calls the Heritage Foundation thinks will make Project 2025 easier to implement the next time an orange Republican sock puppet gets elected.

This is a fucking joke.  Fix the Court.  End lifetime appointments for all federal judges.  Enforce a code of ethics, no matter how minimal, because hey, at least we caught Santos and Menendez.  How much you want to bet this won't fly with Republicans but will be fine with Democrats?  At least Menendez resigned.  Santos had to be expelled.  So . . . give that enforcement process some teeth.
