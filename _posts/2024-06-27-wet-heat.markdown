About a year ago, I posted about how at this time of year I always start thinking about moving.  Now it's more of a plan.  Da Lat is running about 75 degrees, rainy and 90% humidity.  I know that last number seems daunting, but when it's 75 out, it's less oppressive.

At least, less oppressive than it has been here, lately.  100+ and 50%+ humidity.  I truly dislike this weather.  I've spent almost all of my life here, I think it's time for some rain.

A lot of rain.

All the rain.
