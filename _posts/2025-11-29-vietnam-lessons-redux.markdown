Now with more needless French plantation scenes.

This month-long trip was basically a trial run for moving to Vietnam full time.  Different lessons learned, but here they are.

# Scooters (Still) Rule Vietnam

But sadly are much harder to acquire.  You must have a motorcycle endorsement on an actual International Driver's Permit (IDP).  My first task upon returning to the US has been to get that endorsement.  At least it's not hard, a weekend class and short exam will cover it.

Since we couldn't have a scooter, we had a car.  Our car was just the right size, which means subcompact.  We had a [Hyundai i10](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/cars/i10/highlights) sedan (I was hoping for the hatchback, but they didn't have one available), which was all the car we really needed.  And in the city, parking a car this size was actually much easier than I had hoped.  There were still plenty of times where I wished quite loudly that I had a scooter instead.  

Once we move there, we are planning on getting [two](https://bikez.com/models/honda_airblade.php) [scooters](https://www.vespa.com/us_EN/), a legit [small motorcycle](https://www.ducati.com/us/en/bikes/hypermotard), and a [Suzuki Jimny](https://www.globalsuzuki.com/automobile/lineup/jimny/index.html).

# Working with Vietnam Airlines

Since our last trip, Vietnam Airlines introduced a direct SFO to SGN flight, which we utilized for our main travel.  They're also still the best option for domestic travel.  We booked our SGN to Da Lat flight very early as well, and that turned out to be a second mistake.  The first mistake?  When I signed up with their [LotusMiles](https://www.vietnamairlines.com/us/en/lotusmiles) program (which I do like, very much), I mistakenly only entered my first name in the field marked first name (pro tip: let your passport be your guide and put both in there).  This turned into quite an issue, as my passport has first and middle names.  

When we checked in at SFO, I got quite the hassle because the name on my ticket (which came from my LotusMiles account) did not match the name on my passport exactly.  We got a form letter stating that if we did not rectify this mal-personage, we might be denied boarding future flights.  Scary.

While this seems like an easy fix, it was not.  When we arrived in Vietnam, we took our little paper of admonishment up to the service counter.  Keep in mind, this is Vietnam Airline's hub.  Major hub too.  I was told to email their service department.

OK, so, we get to the hotel (our favorite [Nesta](https://nestahotel.com.vn/en/hotel/nesta-sai-gon-central-hotel-1174), I break out my laptop, and send an email.  Basically stating that I needed my name changed on my outstanding tickets, and also needed my name changed on my LotusMiles account so this issue would not happen again.  This did result in interacting with two different support systems, and about half a dozen emails, plus a small fee to change my name on the tickets.

Now, you may be thinking, wait, can't you change your name on your account yourself?  I would have thought so, but no.  You have to work with Vietnam Airlines customer service.

As an American, I generally expect things to be fixed fairly quickly.  Here's what you need to know:

- Email is the best (and often only) way to interact with Vietnam Airlines customer support, yes, even if you speak Vietnamese.
- It will take two or three days to get fixed.
- It ***will*** get fixed, you must trust that.

The second issue, booking too early, resulted in our pre-paid exit row seats being cancelled, multiple times over the 11 months between purchasing and flying.  The way to fix this, as well, is via email.

Just email them.  And be patient.

# Get A Local SIM

I don't have any particular recommendation here.  Since my wife is Vietnamese and fluent, she got a SIM at [Viettel](https://www.vietteltelecom.vn/vx/), a major carrier in Vietnam.  It was cheap, fast, and also got us a Vietnam phone number, which I will say came in handy.  So I guess that's the recommendation: get a local number.

I am on T-Mobile, and while the data is still unlimited, they cap it at 256k or something after a bit.  This did cause some headaches, but I was able to hot-spot on to the wife's phone easily enough.

Longer term, I will be getting a legit phone number in Vietnam, and will probably try to retain my T-Mobile account as well.  It's just very handy for shorter international trips, but there are probably some other good options.

# Google Maps, Still Best

Last time, Apple Maps didn't live update.  Now it does, but Google Maps still wins on a couple of fronts.

First, the "[plus-code](https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/)" thing works with Grab (more on that later).  This makes it very simple to be very specific with pick up and drop off locations.

Google Maps also has more up to date details, street views, and so on.  I just think Apple Maps is going to lag here, mostly because Android is a dominant player.

Shared favorites lists came in really handy for us, once we figured out how to use them properly.  And having the maps right on my dashboard was, as always, super helpful while driving these crazy streets.

With limited bandwidth, though, using Google Maps in offline mode is a must.  That said, Google Maps is a bit of a bitch about it.  I would download offline maps for use, but if there's even a trickle of data available, Google Maps tries to suck it up to do even the most basic location searches.  Annoying.  So, I went into my cellular data settings and basically told my phone that Google Maps (and also Instagram) is no longer welcome to use my cellular data.  This forced Google Maps to behave properly.

It also forced me to stay off Instagram unless I was around wi-fi, which is a good way to stay engaged in your surroundings.

I could have also solved this with hot-spotting or my own local SIM.

# Grab Grab Grab

[Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) is an amazing tool for hiring cars, and getting food delivery.  Much better regulated than either Uber or Lyft in my opinion.  And truly inexpensive.  We used Grab extensively in Da Lat, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  

One of the biggest lessons learned we had was this: Grab to get **to** the airport, taxi to get **from** the airport.  You can set a Grab pickup for up to a week in advance (in my experience), which is ideal for getting to the airport.  We never had a car arrive late to collect us.  

On the other hand, pre-ordering a Grab **from** the airport didn't work out.  While you do put in your flight details and even tell the system how long after the flight lands will be needed (are you picking up checked bags or not, essentially), we found it quite frustrating.  The checked bags estimate was grossly wrong, we had our bags in 20 minutes when the system said 75 minutes, so we ended up sitting for a long time waiting, while plenty of taxis zoomed off with their passengers.  Also we ended up getting switched out on drivers three times.  So in the end, much better to just grab one of the waiting taxis when you land.

It's still ideal for getting around town, ordering food delivery, and getting to the airport.  It links directly with your credit card (if you have a credit card that can be used internationally, of course: [Capital One Venture X](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/venture-x/) is my recommendation), so there's no money worries.

My only gripe is that it caps tips for drivers at ₫100,000.  That's a little under $4.  I would have happily tipped more (I do, generally, on ride apps, because that money goes to the driver directly), and in many cases I paid a cash tip as well.  I know, I know, Americans and their need to tip everyone.  

# You Mentioned Credit Cards...

Why yes, I did.  But I need to mention something else.  And the "something else" is that, in Vietnam, once you're outside the main cities and tourist areas, many smaller businesses (and even some large ones) do not take credit cards.  What they *do* take is QR code payments directly to their bank.  It solves a lot of processing fees, which are murder for a small business doing transactions that amount to mere pennies in US currency.

The problem for tourists is that it's basically impossible to use these, so you end up taking cash out of the ATM, for not great exchange rates (and, unless you're using the right bank, foreign transaction fees and possible per-use fees as well).  Now, we did rely on this for cash while we were there.  But we also found an option for QR code payments.

It's called [Moreta Pay](https://moretapay.com), it's on the App Stores, and it works amazingly well (provided your network is speedy - see above about getting a local SIM).  It's backed by stablecoin, to handle the currency exchanges simply and cheaply.  It works with [VietQR](https://vietqr.io/en/), which is the most popular QR code we saw there.  And you can fund it directly from your US bank account for no additional fees, so long as you fund over $250 in a single transaction.

You can also fund the account with a credit card, though there is a small fee for that, and even Apple Pay can be used to fund it with your debit card (similar fee).

Credit card transactions are instant, bank transfers take a couple days to clear, so think ahead.  I funded a large chunk all at once, and it lasted me a few weeks.  If I needed something faster, I'd use my credit card to fund just the amount required.

If you don't have a US bank account because you're not in the US, may I suggest [Wise](https://wise.com)?  It works directly with Moreta Pay, gives you an ATM/debit card, works with Apple Pay and even earns you good interest on your deposit.  

As to the ATM thing, I wouldn't use Wise except in an emergency, but I do plan on getting a [Capital One 360](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/online-checking-account/) account.  No ATM fees anywhere ever.  Just what the bank itself charges.  And if you use my favorite MB Bank from my last post, you can do well with minimal costs.

If you are a VPN user, beware!  It causes fintech headaches in most cases.  Also, we used an app called [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/us/en) to do some transfers to Vietnam companies prior to our trip.  While it worked fine from US soil, we ran into some hassles while trying to use it in Vietnam (possibly also VPN related - but they also flag large transactions and force you to call them, which gets expensive).  Since most companies have a VietQR code, and Moreta Pay can load from your phone's photo albums, I suggest trying that before Remitly.  Jut have the company send you the QR code image and Moreta away.  The advantage of Remitly is instant funding from your credit card on demand.  Moreta Pay wants the money there before initiation of the transaction.

# Getting Back Out

Da Lat's flight schedule is limited, with no international flights.  You will have to fly to Hanoi or HCMC first, and the schedule never aligns right with your international connection.  Plan on flying to HCMC first, spending a night at the lovely Nesta hotel, and flying to anywhere in the world the next day.  Call it Vietnam Time, the same time the airline uses to fix stuff you email them about.  A minor hassle at best.

Long term, though, I will love living in Da Lat.  Once I find a Vietnamese language course that can actually teach me.

# Random Musings

We didn't do a lot of tours this time.  But we did one that I can't recommend highly enough: [Hanoi Backstreet Tours](https://hanoibackstreettours.com/tours/hanoi-jeep-tour/) does a half day tour that is simply amazing.  While the Train Street has now been closed (thanks mostly to idiot influencers nearly getting themselves killed - my only issue being "nearly" frankly), this is an epic tour capped off with delicious food.  A fantastic ride that I would love to take again.

Ho Chi Minh City has a metro now.  It's cheap and clean and popular and well maintained.  It doesn't go anywhere much right now, except [Suoi Tien Theme Park](https://english.suoitien.vn) on the outskirts of the city, but our favorite Nesta is mere steps from one terminus of the line.  Give it a ride!
