Another month, another post.  I am feeling rather proud of my kids, so I figured I'd post about it now, rather than waiting a month for the more obligatory timeline.

First off, eldest child is completing yet another year of college, which is amazing.  There have been plenty of struggles this last year, with health, and other challenges, but eldest has overcome and is stacking up the credits.

Middle child just completed a run of an original telling of *Dracula* at the local community theather.  It's that magic age where both the adult and "junior" ensembles are available, so, with plenty to choose from, I was thrilled to see that performance.  The end of high school looms, and University beckons.  Where?  No idea yet.  I've suggested some place with nicer weather.

Youngest child is approaching both high school and driving age.  Plus there's a bass drum that's gonna get extra work in the marching band, thanks to a successful audition!  I'm really looking forward to teaching some driving skills, as the older kids didn't want to get their licenses.  A certain affinity for F1 racing may make this more interesting than expected, but it's all good in the end.

Short post.  And one that's a little less "get off my lawn" than the last couple, at least I hope.
