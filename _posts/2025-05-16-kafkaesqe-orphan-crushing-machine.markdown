The company I work for is growing.  This is, broadly, a good thing, as it means I will continue to be employed and also continue to have health insurance.  It also means that there is change in the air, and as usual it feels like change for the sake of change, because the new HR department has new "ideas" that will "change the paradigm" and "provide efficiencies" and replace "outmoded thinking".

This month, a switch from our former payroll provider to a "new and improved" payroll provider.  Where by "new and improved", I presume HR means "cheaper".  Certainly, the new app looks more slick, like it was ginned up by some graphic designers who really love using GoDaddy to design their websites, but strangely relies on older authentication technology (read: "cheaper" authentication technology), so it looks like I'm back to use a username and password that is entered through a pop-up browser window, rather than the passkey integrated into the app itself.  Progress!  But I'm losing a little focus here, so let me get back on topic.

Now, as a small business, we had contracted with a very large payroll provider that also offered medical insurance.  Handy, since if a company has more than 50 employees, said company is legally required, as part of the ACA, to provide health coverage options or pay a significant fine.  This was the ACA attempting to ensure everyone who works and pays taxes has medical coverage.  Which could also have been done simply shifting to single-payer socialized medicine.  But let's not go there, yet.

So, the change in payroll providers means there's also a change in medical providers, since the new payroll company, which also manages said benefits, is not using the same providers that the former one was using.  So, we had about two weeks to figure out which of the new plans we wanted and get all that set up.  It's not what I would call an enjoyable process, sitting through Open Enrollment Benefits Options calls, and hearing a lot of noise and almost no real information.  It's generally one of the more onerous requirements of the orphan crushing machine that is American healthcare that occurs when one changes jobs.  Except that I didn't even change jobs.  And this could also have been avoided by simply shifting to single-payer socialized medicine.  But let's not go there, yet.

As part of the process with the new provider, comes a hilarious new offer: Hospitalization Indemnification Insurance.  Which broadly means, if you get hit with a huge hospital bill, this extra insurance will cover it!  Or maybe it won't.  When you read the fine print, it clearly reserves the right of the insurer to deny a claim from the insured.  Which . . . gosh . . . where have I heard this sort of asinine clause before?  Oh right, every single orphan crushing machine policy I've ever had.  It's a bullshit clause, and one of the many reasons why we should simply shift to single-payer socialized medicine.  But let's not go there, yet.

Anyway, I declined the extra insurance to cover the insurance if the insurance doesn't actually insure me, because it was just too fucking Kafkaesque (even more Kafkaesque: the enrollment process asks me ***why*** I decided not to enroll in this coverage, but doesn't give you enough characters to adequately explain in the same way this blog post is able to, so I just said, "Didn't have this coverage before.").  What kind of world would allow a gap in insurance coverage to become another profit generating offer from the same goddamn companies that are causing the problem in the first fucking place (the problem being, of course, that even with medical insurance, they can deny, delay and depose until you are completely destitute because of the medical bill from when you got hit by one of their dump trucks full of money on it's way to their fucking shareholders)?  The orphan crushing machine can be stopped by feeding orphans into a different crushing machine.  Or, you know, we could stop all of this idiocy right now by simply shifting to single-payer socialized medicine.  

But let's not go there, yet.

Because the insurance companies haven't bled us dry enough already.  Luigi was right: feed the CEOs to the orphan crushing machine.
