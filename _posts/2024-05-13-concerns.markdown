I'm looking at these new iPad Pros that are thinner than a 7th generation iPod Nano.  You may have seen the advert somewhere.  I won't post it here.  What I will say is that, thanks to my father, I actually ***have*** a 7th gen iPod Nano sitting on my desk.

I purchased it for him because he wanted a way to listen to his music in the hospital, and this seemed like the best option.  Simple interface, he didn't have that much music anyway, and I also set it up with plenty of photos of family.  Plus it has a built in radio, and at the time all the headphones were wired (it used the wire as the antenna).  He enjoyed using it for a while, but it never was really his thing.  It was a hospital device, something he used to pass the time.  

All that aside, the new iPad being slimmer than this 10 year old device is stunning.  When I put said Nano next to my current iPhone 15, it looks thick by comparison (the iPhone 15 is not anyone's definition of a thick phone these days).  It's some seriously amazing engineering and I think I'm going to have to purchase one.
