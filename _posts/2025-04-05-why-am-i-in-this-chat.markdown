It is completely insane that the kakistocracy now in charge included a journalist in a war planning meeting. You can read the [entire chat thread](https://meidasnews.com/news/read-here-the-atlantic-releases-full-leaked-signal-message-thread) (right down to the absurd emojis) here.  I mean, since it's not classified?  Except that it is?  [Or it should be?](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/was-the-signal-chat-illegal/)

Much has been made of this, so my observations are really just an extension of the already damning reporting from other outlets on why this is terrible.

But here's some other thoughts that don't seem to be getting enough air time:

First, isn't this chat explicitly applauding what is essentially a war crime?  Or at least a terrorist-style attack by the US military on a civilian target?  I suppose some be-hatted-idiot will decry this view as anti-American, but bombing an entire civilian apartment complex reeks of criminal activity.

Second, Signal is one of the few companies who have repeatedly told governments to [pound sand over wanting backdoor access to encrypted communications](https://www.protectprivacynow.org/news/why-signal-refuses-to-give-government-backdoor-access-to-americans-encrypted-communications).  We hear over and over that only bad guys encrypt their chats, that only criminals need the protection of secure communications.  And generally the politicians who pout about this are, well, Republicans or similar right-leaning authoritarians.  Yet here they are, claiming there was nothing to see.  Then why use Signal?

And an extension to that: Signal can be set to delete chats, and the screenshots posted above clearly show that this was the case, set to delete after a week.  Now, they could claim that that's just the default, but then Waltz resets the time himself to 4 weeks.  So they clearly knew what they were doing, and this is clearly a direct violation of the [Federal Records Act](https://www.archives.gov/news/topics/federal-records-act), which was put into place in 1950, you know, back when America was great, or whatever.  Covering your tracks isn't a good look.

There's also the rather disgusting fact that the [investigation](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d6850eyeo) into this obvious breach of security is being undertaken by the US Department of Defense, and not the Department of Justice or FBI, as it should be.  Gee, I can't imagine why, since the entire Executive branch is [full of bootlickers and sycophants](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/politics/hillary-biden-warrants-signalgate-trump-kfile/index.html).

But last, I have to say, if this is the civilian leadership of our military, I'd certainly hate to be in any kind of uniform right now.  Sure, this time it was a journalist, but Signal has known vulnerabilities, [based around linked devices](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/25/nx-s1-5339801/pentagon-email-signal-vulnerability), that can allow practically invisible access if just one account is compromised.  And since these "leaders" clearly have no idea what they're doing in regards to technology or anything else (one of these morons [can't even recall what country she was in](https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/tulsi-gabbard-s-memory-disorder-worsens-i-don-t-recall-which-country-i-was-in-video/ar-AA1BIdU4) when the messages arrived, and another was [literally in Russia](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-envoy-steve-witkoff-signal-text-group-chat-russia-putin/), well known for their ***highly secure*** internet), I'd say it's a pretty safe bet that bad actors can listen in to Signal chats.  Which is why you don't plan or discuss military actions ([idiotic semantic arguing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2025/03/28/hegseth-says-he-didnt-text-war-plans-screenshots-show-details/82704745007/) aside) on fucking Signal.

But [this kind of disrespect is what Republicans voted for](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3370572/trump-skips-dover-ceremony-four-soldiers-killed-lithuania/), so I guess this is what they wanted.
