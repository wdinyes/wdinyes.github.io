I had an interesting chat with a fellow traveler along the divorce path.  She said to me, "You know, you make all these plans and you have this vision for where you're gonna be, and you trusted someone else to share that vision, and then it falls apart, and you're adrift."

I see her point.  

I had plans.  I really did.  I had this arc of my life pretty well planned out.  And I worked to make it that way!

Until I couldn't.  

And that makes you wary of trusting anyone else ever again.  Wary of inviting them into your life, reluctant to share your vision, and worst of all, distrustful that even with your best intentions and effort, it simply will fail again, and you'll find yourself living in a shotgun shack.

So, what do you do?

You let the Wookie win.

I'm embracing the chaos.  I'm looking at my situation and saying, "You know what? This is an opportunity to go big with the life changes."  That's where the idea to move to Vietnam sprouted.  And my earlier plan of just buying a boat and living as a nomad.  It, of course, is easier when you have a good paying job that you can do from anywhere an internet connection exists, I'm not discounting my privilege here.

My goal, such as it is, is to get rid of this house I live in.  It has too many reminders of a future that will now never be.  What I do after that is all up to me.  Small move, big move, whatever suits my fancy.  

And, of course, that of any fellow travelers I meet along the way, of course.
