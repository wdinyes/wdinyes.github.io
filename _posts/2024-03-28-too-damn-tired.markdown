My good colleague at work has been away for a little over three months.  He was the guy who kinda got me started writing this monthly missive of random stuff.  I heard this week that he has decided not to return to us.  This makes me quite sad: he's a good man, and he's had some struggles, but I really truly think he could still be successful here with us.  We're losing someone who had an amazing knowledge of Kubernetes, who designed an amazing lab environment for us, and solved just so many problems for us, and now he's gone.

My sister's father-in-law passed very unexpectedly this week.  I have to believe he knew it was time and made some decisions that seemed stubborn and selfish on the outside, but that he was working from a script that none of us knew, and just decided to roll the dice and see what happens.

I made some bad decisions last week that alienated some people.  I am trying to make amends for those, and committing to some changes in my life to hopefully improve myself.  We shall see what the future brings there.

My friend had to put his dog down in the middle of all this as well.  He was a very good dog, and I'm sure it's leaving quite a hole in his life.  I'm doing what I can to be supportive, but it's not much.

And the end result of all this is that I'm feeling far too tired to deal with any of it.
