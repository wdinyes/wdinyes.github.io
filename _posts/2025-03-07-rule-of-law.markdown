I have spent most of my adult life with the understanding that we have a body of law that applies to everyone.  

In many cases, wealth subverts this, and justice is denied, or at least watered down, when enough cash can be spent to buy the verdict or mild punishment desired.

In other cases, the color of one's skin becomes the deciding factor, with "promising young men" who are invariably white, receive no punishment for the same crime a black man will go to prison for.

But I still believed that the rule of law tended towards justice.

I still do.

However, I no longer trust those who are charged with enforcing the rule of law.

The Executive branch is now daily breaking the law with [illegal firings](https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/judge-strikes-down-doge-led-memo-directing-mass-firing-of-federal-employees-illegal-and-must-be-rescinded/ar-AA1zWT1O), withholding of [Congressionally allocated funding](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/unconstitutional-and-illegal-trump-rubio-musk-systematically-dismantled-usaid-in-unlawful-usurping-of-legislative-authority-lawsuit-claims/), and generally signalling that the [US Constitution is a dead letter](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/trump-third-term-white-house-022002).

The majority of the Legislative branch [seems happy](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/02/president-trump-unitary-executive-branch-congress/80517757007/) to continue to allow this, while attempting to find ways to [kiss ass](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/04/trump-on-100-dollar-bill/81366063007/).

And the Judicial branch now seems to think that said rule of law [depends on who is in the White House](https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/alito-stunned-by-court-exercising-judicial-power-he-championed-expanded-just-months-ago/).

So.  [Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me](https://americansongwriter.com/behind-the-meaning-of-rage-against-the-machines-1992-hit-killing-in-the-name/).
