Every year about this time I start thinking about moving.  

It's hot here.  And, it turns out, I don't really like to be hot.  Well, certainly not every time I step outside.  When it's in the 90s at 4 AM, that's a problem.

I feel like Santa Fe would be nice, pretty much year round.  Sure, a little snow in the winter, but not so much it shuts down everything.  But it's also pretty isolated from everything.  

San Diego is incredible basically year round, plus beaches.  But the only way to afford to live in California anymore is to go back in time and buy a house in the 1970s.  

Most places along the Gulf Coast . . . that's a roulette wheel for the next hurricane, so I don't want that.

The East Coast at least has cheap flights to Europe.  But while the West Coast is a choice between rain and taxes, the East Coast is a choice between snow and . . . well . . . Florida.  So no.

What about Europe?  Germany would be great, I think.

Or maybe Singapore?  Vietnam?  Australia?  How far am I willing to go?

But then I think about my kids and my friends and I think, you know, maybe I can handle the heat for one more summer.
