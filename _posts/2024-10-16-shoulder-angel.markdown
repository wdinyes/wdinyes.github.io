Disney has these weird little Shoulder Buddies.  It's basically a little magnetic disk that sits under your shirt, and a plush that sticks to it.  Designed to sit on your shoulder.  My son got a porg (you know, that delicious Star Wars snack animal).  They have things like Remy from Ratatouille, and Zero from Nightmare Before Christmas.  I got my daughter a Zazu.  I figure they probably have lot of these.

But not the ones we all deserve, and that's Kronk's Shoulder Angel and Devil.  C'mon, what a gimme.

Disney, do better.
