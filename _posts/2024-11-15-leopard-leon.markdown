Leon, I know you're too dumb to notice this, but the leopard is eating your face.

Don't believe me?

He appointed a [babysitter](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-department-of-government-efficiency-trump/index.html) for your dubious official role.  He doesn't even trust you to destroy things on your own.  I mean, that's really his job.

That babysitter has said he wants to [defund unauthorized programs](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/vivek-ramaswamy-wants-to-start-doge-cuts-by-eliminating-funding-for-unauthorized-programs-including-veteran-healthcare/ar-AA1u6rmW), like support for the ISS, which I believe makes one of your companies a large portion of it's income (almost a billion dollars to [help dismantle it](https://www.popsci.com/science/spacex-iss-retirement/)).  I mean, it's gonna fuck with veterans (Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, gets about $120 billion still) and working families (Head Start, helps provide educational access to low income families) too, but, mostly, it's going to burn your rockets to the ground.

Your buddy has said he's going to [end the EV tax credit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/).  Last time I checked, that is another one of your companies he's actively trying to crater.

But maybe he'll come back to your little fascist fun house?  Nah, he's said he's gonna [stay in his fascist fun house](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trump-media-shares-rise-after-trump-says-he-wont-sell-2024-11-08/) for a good while longer.  I guess that means yet another of your companies he's going to try to tank.  I mean, his house is [worth more than yours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-stock-musk-x-social-5328feb1a782cc65bd05b7e30756b8db) now, so I am sure he's sleeping with a smug grin on his face, having beaten you in yet another way you haven't seemed to have noticed.

But he likes you, right?  Right.  Because he stood up in front of his cadre of useful congress idiots and compared you to [a case of herpes](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-jokes-cant-get-rid-elon-musk-1985310).

You paid for his re-election, and he's eating your face, dumbass.

Wake up, Leon.
